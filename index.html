        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi, my name is Danyelle! I am an up an coming software developer who is beyond excited to make your ideas come to life!
            I work in basic HTML, CSS, and so far JavaScript, thought I am learning more in depth techniques. I love to constantly learn new things
            whether its for hobbies or work. For fun I tend to dive into playing videogames, playing with the dogs, or going outdoors. 
            I want to learn how to develop video games next as I hold it close to me. Growing up with two older brothers gave me love for the way games
            work. Lets make some ideas become reality!
